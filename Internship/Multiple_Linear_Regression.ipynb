    "Correlation is a statistical technique that can show whether and how strongly pairs of variables are related.Correlation is described as the analysis which lets us know the association or the absence of the relationship between two variables ‘x’ and ‘y’. It is a statistical measure that represents the strength of the connection between pairs of variables.\n",
    "Difference between correlation and regression:\n",
    "1. In correlation, there is no difference between dependent and independent variables i.e. correlation between x and y is similar to y and x. Conversely, the regression of y on x is different from x on y.\n",
    "2. Correlation indicates the strength of association between variables. As opposed to, regression reflects the impact of the unit change in the independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "3. Correlation aims at finding a numerical value that expresses the relationship between variables. Unlike regression whose goal is to predict values of the random variable on the basis of the values of fixed variable.\n",
    "4. Correlation is used to represent the linear relationship between two variables. On the contrary, regression is used to fit the best line and estimate one variable on the basis of another variable.\n",
    "5. A statistical measure which determines the co-relationship or association of two quantities is known as Correlation. Regression describes how an independent variable is numerically related to the dependent variable."

Upon examining the residuals we detect a problem – the residuals are very small for low values of family income (almost all families with low incomes don’t spend much on luxury items) while there is great variation in the size of the residuals for wealthier families (some families spend a great deal on luxury items while some are more moderate in their luxury spending).
